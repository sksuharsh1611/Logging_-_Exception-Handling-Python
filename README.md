Levels of Logging in Python

The logging module in Python provides a powerful and flexible way to record events and messages from a running application. It allows developers to fine-tune the amount of detail recorded by the logging system by defining different levels of severity or importance.

The levels of logging in Python, in increasing order of severity, are:

1. NOTSET: The lowest possible level, used to indicate that no logging is done.

2. DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.

3. INFO: General information about the application's operation, such as startup messages and status updates.

4. WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., 'disk space low').

5. ERROR: An error occurred that should be investigated, such as an unhandled exception.

6. CRITICAL: A very serious error occurred, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

By default, the logging module sets the level to WARNING, which means that only events with a severity level of WARNING or higher will be logged. However, developers can easily adjust the level to suit their needs by modifying the logger's level attribute or using the basicConfig() function.

Selecting the appropriate level of logging for each message in your Python code can make it easier to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance. By recording only relevant information at the appropriate severity level, developers can quickly identify the root cause of problems and reduce noise in the logs.

Proper logging is an essential component of software development and can help improve the maintainability and reliability of your code. By understanding the different levels of logging available in Python and how to use them effectively, developers can ensure that their code is well-documented and easy to debug.
